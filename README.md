## About cerv.AI

cerv.AI is a project under the Department of Science and Technology - Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI). The aim of the project is to develop a screening system that will utilize deep learning models to increase cervical cancer detection in the Philippines, by up to **70%** of the female population.

### Cervical Cancer in the Philippines
Cervical cancer is the [fourth](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer) most prominent cancer in female worldwide. Moreover, it is the [second](https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/news/2023/cervical_coverage.pdf) most prominent in the Philippines. In partnership with [cerviQ](https://endcervicalcancerph.com/), the DOST-ASTI developed the cerv.AI project to increase the inexpensive screening methods of cervical cancer, to reduce the cost for the more expensive screening methods, and to continuously increase the vaccination with the female population for the Human papillomavirus (HPV). 

### Goal of the project (2030)
- **90%** of girls fully vaccinated by HPV (There are only 23% vaccinated for the first dose, and 5% for the second dose).
- **70%** high-performance test and screening (less than 1% are currently screened nationwide)
- **90%** of positive cases receive treatment (Approximately 50-60% have received treatment from the screened cases)
